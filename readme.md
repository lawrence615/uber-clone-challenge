## Uber Clone Challenge
This is a React Native app built using TailwindCSS and a number of Google Maps API to simulate how an Uber app works.

The design has been done using TailwindCSS, which is very friendly, and Google Maps API:
- Directions API - directions from A - B
- Distance Matrix API - mileage calculations
- Places API
- Maps SDK for Android - had to be enabled to work on Android

This is thanks to the good work of **Sonny Sangha** and the entire video tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvn_HYpix6s)
